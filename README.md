# Gridworld-Q-Learning
This notebook provides a custom implementation of Gridworld.


### Dependencies
- Numpy

### Usage
- Notebook as cell with implementation of a Gridworld class
- Part 1 is a single Q-Learning Agent
- Part 2 is an implemenation of a Q-Learning Agent class, with a shared Q function 
- Each part has a section that highlights the performance of the model, with time-steps vs. cumulative reward/step

### Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to provide an understanding of the underlying algorithms behind more complex RL (reinforcement learning) agents
